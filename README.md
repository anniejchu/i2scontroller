# System Verilog i2scontroller
ENGR3420 Computer Architecture 

Annie Chu & Manu Patil

In this project, we set to build a i2s controller in SystemVerilog to play music out of a speaker. Our MVP was to play an input .wav file and play it through an external speaker. Our stretch goal was replace a .wav file with a MIDI input.

### Hardware
- Xilinx Vivado
- MAX98357A I2S AMP BREAKOUT BOARD
- SPEAKER 8OHM 500MW
